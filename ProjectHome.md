A processing pathway for visual data has been used for the design of FRVS which permits the study of collective performance of two or more algorithms when they work in unison. Viola-Jones based Algorithm and AdaBoost face detection algorithms are used to realize the face extraction stage of FRVS. Comparitive study of these two algorithms suggests that AdaBoost algorithm is better suited for real time operations. Subspace Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) and Face recognition using Eigenfaces are the two algorithms implemented in the face recognition stage of FRVS. This stage uses results from the two algorithms to improve the overall accuracy of the recognition procedure. The FRVS image database includes faces of an individual in different lightening, postures etc. FRVS cannot be used as a complete software based solution for security. However, it can be used to assist security personnels. Anyone who wants to track/recognise the entry/exit of humans in an area can use FRVS for security or some other fields such as persons counting, attendence, etc.
